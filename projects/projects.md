### Arduino Brushless DC Motor Turbo Helicopter
{: .content-title} 
Jan 2016 – Apr 2016
{: .content-date}

*	Designed a helicopter simulation model with two self-design brushless DC motors, 3D print parts designed by Solidworks and control units running by Arduino. Design process involve 3D printing, PCB layout design, prototype board soldering and machine fabrication
*	Integrating different fields of Electrical Engineering to demo the concepts, such as electromechanism, system control, signal processing and electronic circuit design. This model demos the action of helicopter such as rising up, rotate 180, and landing with 2 degrees of freedom

### Elevator Controller Simulation in C++
{: .content-title} 
October 2015 – October 2015
{: .content-date}

* Designed a C++ project in OOP style to simulate an elevator controller with graphic user interface. The controller can run at least two 10-floors elevators. It can also determine which elevator to send request for the highest efficiency, and is able to pause a specific elevator for maintenance
* Used mutual exclusion techniques such as pooling, semaphores and monitors and ensure the flow and integration of all data flows
